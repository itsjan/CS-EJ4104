      <description>You may be wondering why a person takes the DevOps course at Aalto University or any other course for that matter. Some people may be influenced by their friends or family, the prospect of having a huge income as a DevOps engineer or maybe the course is related to oneâ€™s passion. Well, I would like to share with you my reasons and why I took the DevOps course.
With the many courses offered at Aalto, I choose to attend the DevOps course because I believe that the only way to reduce manual labour in software development and operations is to engage in DevOps.</description>

      <description>Over the years, I have learned about many subjects and studied through classes as well as by myself. I know without doubt that many of these subjects are living and applicable to our everyday lives. However, even if I learn about new topics every day for the rest of my life, there is always going to be many more.
There is so much to look forward to after successfully completing the DevOps course!</description>
