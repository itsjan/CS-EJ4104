		<p>You may be wondering why a person takes the DevOps course at Aalto University or any other course for that matter. Some people may be influenced by their friends or family, the prospect of having a huge income as a DevOps engineer or maybe the course is related to one’s passion. Well, I would like to share with you <em>my</em> reasons and why <em>I</em> took the DevOps course.</p>
<p>With the many courses offered at Aalto, I choose to attend the DevOps course because I believe that the only way to reduce manual labour in software development and operations is to engage in DevOps.</p>
<p>After a careful comparison between the best and worst case scenarios of what could follow if I joined the DevOps course, I came to a conclusion that the best-case outcome outweighed the worst-case by far.</p>
<p>I knew I did not want another course that could have been “DevOps for dummies”. I also wanted a hands-on approach and to be able to work at my own pace. Other similar courses I looked at may have offered that option, but they came with a high price-tag of thousands of euros.</p>
<p>With the Aalto DevOps course I did not need to worry that my expectations were not going to be met. Many of my family members and friends graduated from this course over the past several years, and I have not heard or read a single  bad review. My peers at the Aalto courses have been wonderful and inspiring, and I have always gotten the most insightful feedback on my work.</p>
