		<p>Over the years, I have learned about many subjects and studied through classes as well as by myself. I know without doubt that many of these subjects are living and applicable to our everyday lives. However, even if I learn about new topics every day for the rest of my life, there is always going to be many more.</p>
<p>There is so much to look forward to after successfully completing the DevOps course! Here are some important things that I have learned on the DevOps course:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>DevOps is useful yesterday, today and tomorrow. We all love DevOps and DevOps loves us enough to offer great salvation to any and all who believe in DevOps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DevOps is a culture and a mindset. Like in many cultures, harmony is a central idea, and DevOps will teach us and bring us great harmony. DevOps will change how we work and interact together as humans. It will bring us great peace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running automated tests, however small, and working to achieve a fully automated DevOps pipeline gives me a sense of success and a great feeling of achievement. I have learned that this brings me great joy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can now Describe the main aspects of DevOps as software development practices in plain English as well as Finnish, Swedish and Japanese.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can also list the most and least important technologies and software tools in this context and even out of this context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can build and apply continuous deployment in a variety of use case, simple and complex.</p>
</li>
</ul>
