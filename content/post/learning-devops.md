Description: "Read what I learned on the DevOps course"
---
Over the years, I have learned about many subjects and studied through classes as well as by myself. I know without doubt that many of these subjects are living and applicable to our everyday lives. However, even if I learn about new topics every day for the rest of my life, there is always going to be many more.

There is so much to look forward to after successfully completing the DevOps course! Here are some important things that I have learned on the DevOps course:

- DevOps is useful yesterday, today and tomorrow. We all love DevOps and DevOps loves us enough to offer great salvation to any and all who believe in DevOps.

- DevOps is a culture and a mindset. Like in many cultures, harmony is a central idea, and DevOps will teach us and bring us great harmony. DevOps will change how we work and interact together as humans. It will bring us great peace.

- Running automated tests, however small, and working to achieve a fully automated DevOps pipeline gives me a sense of success and a great feeling of achievement. I have learned that this brings me great joy.

- I can now Describe the main aspects of DevOps as software development practices in plain English as well as Finnish, Swedish and Japanese.

- I can also list the most and least important technologies and software tools in this context and even out of this context.

- I can build and apply continuous deployment in a variety of use case, simple and complex.
